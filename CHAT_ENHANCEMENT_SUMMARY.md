# Chat System Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the chat system to support:
1. **Message Deletion**: Users and doctors can delete their sent messages with soft delete functionality
2. **File Uploads**: Support for sending images and documents (multiple files at once)
3. **Enhanced Message Types**: Support for text, image, file, and mixed message types
4. **Maintaining SOLID Principles**: Clean architecture with interfaces and implementations

## Features Implemented

### 1. Message Deletion System
- **Soft Delete**: Messages are marked as deleted but retained in database
- **Restore Functionality**: Users can restore their deleted messages
- **Permanent Delete**: Complete removal from database and file system
- **Authorization**: Users can only delete/restore their own messages

### 2. File Upload System
- **Multiple File Support**: Up to 10 files per message
- **File Types**: Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, TXT)
- **File Size Limit**: 50MB per file
- **Security**: File validation and secure storage
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress

### 3. Enhanced Message Types
- **Text**: Traditional text messages
- **Image**: Image-only messages
- **File**: Document-only messages  
- **Mixed**: Messages with both text and files

## Backend Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
```typescript
// Enhanced ChatMessage model
interface IChatMessage {
  _id: string;
  conversationId: string;
  senderId: string;
  senderType: "user" | "doctor";
  message: string;
  messageType: "text" | "image" | "file" | "mixed";
  timestamp: Date;
  isRead: boolean;
  isDeleted: boolean;      // NEW
  deletedAt?: Date;        // NEW
  deletedBy?: string;      // NEW
  attachments: IAttachment[]; // ENHANCED
}

interface IAttachment {
  fileName: string;
  originalName: string;
  fileType: "image" | "document";
  mimeType: string;
  fileSize: number;
  filePath: string;
  uploadedAt: Date;
}
```

### Repository Layer
**Interface**: `IChatRepository`
- Added soft delete operations

- Added file management methods

**Implementation**: `ChatRepository`
- `softDeleteMessage()`: Mark message as deleted
- `restoreMessage()`: Restore deleted message
- `permanentlyDeleteMessage()`: Complete removal
- `getDeletedMessages()`: Retrieve deleted messages

### Service Layer
**Interface**: `IChatService`
- File upload processing
- Enhanced message operations
- File cleanup utilities

**Implementation**: `ChatService`
- `sendMessageWithFiles()`: Handle file uploads with messages
- `processUploadedFiles()`: Process and validate uploaded files
- `deleteUploadedFiles()`: Clean up files from storage

### Controller Layer
**Interface**: `IChatController`
- File upload endpoints
- Message action endpoints

**Implementation**: `ChatController`
- `sendMessageWithFiles()`: Handle multipart file uploads
- `softDeleteMessage()`: Soft delete endpoint
- `restoreMessage()`: Restore message endpoint
- `serveFile()`: Secure file serving

### Middleware
**File Upload Middleware** (`fileUpload.ts`)
- Multer configuration for file handling
- File type validation
- Size limitations
- Error handling
- Security checks

### API Endpoints

#### New Endpoints Added:
```
POST /api/chat/messages/upload          - Upload files with message (User)
POST /api/chat/messages/doctor/upload   - Upload files with message (Doctor)
PATCH /api/chat/messages/:id/soft-delete - Soft delete message
PATCH /api/chat/messages/:id/restore     - Restore deleted message
DELETE /api/chat/messages/:id/permanent  - Permanently delete message
GET /api/chat/messages/:conversationId/deleted - Get deleted messages
GET /api/chat/files/:fileName           - Serve uploaded files
```

### Socket Events

#### New Events:
- `message_action`: Handle delete/restore/permanent delete
- `message_updated`: Notify clients of message status changes
- `message_permanently_deleted`: Notify permanent deletion
- `file_upload_progress`: Real-time upload progress

## Frontend Implementation

### Type Definitions
Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for type safety:
```typescript
interface Attachment {
  fileName: string;
  originalName: string;
  fileType: "image" | "document";
  mimeType: string;
  fileSize: number;
  filePath: string;
  uploadedAt: Date;
}

interface ChatMessage {
  // ... existing fields
  isDeleted: boolean;
  deletedAt?: Date;
  deletedBy?: string;
  attachments: Attachment[];
}
```

### Components Created

#### FileUpload Component
- Drag and drop interface
- File preview
- Progress tracking
- File validation
- Multiple file selection

#### MessageItem Component
- Attachment display
- Image preview with full-screen modal
- Download functionality for documents
- Message action buttons (delete/restore)
- Visual indicators for deleted messages

### Services Updated
**chatServices.ts**
- `sendMessageWithFilesAPI()`: File upload with progress tracking
- `softDeleteMessageAPI()`: Soft delete operation
- `restoreMessageAPI()`: Restore deleted message
- `downloadFileAPI()`: File download functionality
- Utility functions for file handling

### Socket Context Enhanced
- New socket methods for message actions

- Enhanced message handling

## Security Features

### File Security
- File type validation
- Size limitations
- Secure file paths
- Directory traversal protection
- Sanitized file names

### Authorization
- User can only delete own messages
- File access control
- JWT token validation for file access

### Data Validation

- Input sanitization

## Error Handling

### Backend
- Comprehensive error responses
- File cleanup on failures
- Database transaction safety

### Frontend
- User-friendly error messages
- Upload progress and error states
- Graceful fallbacks

## Performance Considerations

### File Handling
- Streaming file uploads
- Efficient file storage
- Lazy loading for images
- Optimized file serving

### Database
- Indexed queries
- Soft delete for performance
- Pagination support

## Usage Examples

### Sending Message with Files
```typescript
// Frontend
const files = [file1, file2]; // File objects
await sendMessageWithFilesAPI({
  conversationId: "conv123",
  message: "Check out these documents",
  files: files
}, (progress) => {
  console.log(`Upload progress: ${progress}%`);
});
```

### Deleting a Message
```typescript
// Soft delete
await softDeleteMessageAPI(messageId);

// Restore
await restoreMessageAPI(messageId);

// Permanent delete
await permanentlyDeleteMessageAPI(messageId);
```

## Architecture Benefits

### SOLID Principles Maintained
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Implementations can be swapped
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Abstractions over concretions

### Clean Architecture
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Controller layer for HTTP handling
- Clear separation of concerns

### TypeScript Benefits
- Type safety throughout the stack
- Better IDE support
- Compile-time error checking
- Clear interfaces and contracts

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. File compression for images
2. Virus scanning for uploaded files
3. File versioning system
4. Advanced file search
5. File encryption at rest
6. CDN integration for file serving
7. File sharing between conversations
8. Bulk message operations

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for repository methods
- Integration tests for file uploads
- API endpoint testing
- Socket event testing

### Frontend Testing
- Component testing for FileUpload
- API service testing
- Socket event handling tests
